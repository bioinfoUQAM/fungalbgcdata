## Fungal BGC datasets

Datasets built to support the development of supervised learning approaches to identify fungal BGCs.
Folders `pos%neg%` are named by their `%` of positive and negative instances.
Each dataset folder is divided into:
  - train (80% of dataset instances)
  - validation (20% of dataset instances)

#### Dataset instances

The number of instances in fungal BGC datasets are splitted as follows:

| Dataset | Phase | Pos | Neg | Phase | Pos | Neg |
| :----: | :----: | ----: | ----: | :----: | ----: | ----: |
| 50\%-50\%  | Train | 160 | 160 | Validation | 40 | 40 |
| 40\%-60\%  | Train | 160 | 240 | Validation | 40 | 60 |
| 30\%-70\%  | Train | 160 | 373 | Validation | 40 | 93 |
| 20\%-80\%  | Train | 160 | 640 | Validation | 40 | 160 |
| 10\%-90\%  | Train | 160 | 1,440 | Validation | 40 | 360 |
| 05\%-95\%  | Train | 160 | 3,040 | Validation | 40 | 760 |
| 01\%-99\%  | Train | 160 | 15,840 | Validation | 40 | 3,960 |
